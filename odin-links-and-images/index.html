    <!-- While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank -->

    <!-- rel attribute above: this attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

    noopener: The noopener attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk. 
    
    In this code: target=”_blank”: opens the link in a new tab. rel=”noopener”: prevents the new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security.

    noreferrer: The noreferrer attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original page.
